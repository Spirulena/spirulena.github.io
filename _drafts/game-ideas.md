# Momma Bubby !

## Initial idea - spark of mammy inspiration

The idea comes from breast feeding mum who struggles to get a baby off the milk.
What if the player tries to run away from babies screaming "Momma Bubby!!!"
Mummy actions are to run, jump and shoot milk like projectiles to slow down babies and gain advantage.
The goal is to run away to a quiet peace paradise - just a quiet place away from all the screams.

## Game type

### Top-down variant
Both top-down and side view would be suitable.
With top-down something like ["20 Minutes Till Dawn"](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1966900/20_Minutes_Till_Dawn/)

### Side scroller variant

This one seems more suited for one handed mobile operation.
Experimentation and design decisions would have to be driving this variation.

## Off from the real world

There are various elements that can be changed to move away from initial inspiration.
The direct sexuality can also be a consediration to change few elemnts up.
Visually instead of bubby the shape can be changed to mushroom head a like.

## Platforms

Would be easier to start with PC but have mobile in mind.
If not to drive design then to have a clear view of what a mobile version could look and play like.

## Game loop

## Items / powerups

# Game inspired by Eastern Animations like Bolek & Lolek

## Initial brain dump

Man watch this https://youtu.be/Iq5BSiRabHs
How’s that for the inspiration and and art direction
If we’re hanging nostalgia that’s something
Probably you also watched Czech and Russian, Polish as animations  of that era
Kinda Cupcake road but in Eastern Europe spin
Does not have to be done like hand drawn style, could be made as pixel art inspired by that animation art style

PODUSZKOWIEC (1978) - SERIA: PRZYGODY BOLKA I LOLKA 

Actually this episode how they collect mushrooms :mushroom: there’s a game right there

Collection junk to fix their car / hoover; collecting mushrooms, selling them on farmers market, building their playground with earned money like in C64 Donald Duck game;
Chasing butterfly’s, running around making mess, collecting weird garbage that can be sold or swapped with other kids
Foraging for berries, watch out don’t eat the poisonous ones (edited) 

getting on top of big tower to free fall on umbrellas;
Building a glider from collected junk to just cruise around

kinda care free place to go and chill for a while

Whit that upbeat sampled orchestra feel like stardew valley

for upgradability could be released in episodes where you got new adventures added

Like here they going on a holiday https://youtu.be/PTn_A8SQz9c

WAKACYJNE SZLAKI (1977) - SERIA: PRZYGODY BOLKA I LOLKA 

We could add some darker stuff lurking somewhere fitting the night or in distant haunted regions
Like this guy scarred the hell out of me when I was a kid https://youtu.be/6gPPx6d1Ubs

SARENKA (1976) - SERIA: PRZYGODY BOLKA I LOLKA 

## Fight - rather scare tactics
It they would have to fight on their adventures I see it like in turn based JRPG but attack would be to scare off the opponent rather then to kill it
They could have a reversed vacuum to blow the enemy off, a pan to bang on it and make a noise etc
Rather then JRPG something like fight in "Echo Generation" could be considered, where it is not just selecting action but also player have to perform an action.

They could be building hideouts in various locations
There could be kid NPC who always hide behind the bush and is lurking in what the player does

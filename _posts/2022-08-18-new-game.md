I dreamed a game without fighting but game that will meet all the needs of collaboration within and between the teams.

I think we have enough games with fighting and enough clones and that we can do something different.

I am working on game design document that I would like to present later and then have a conversation about all that. Before this I can give you some sneak peek  of an idea that is brewing.

What if instead of fighting you meditate in game to calm your self and produce energy ?
Everyone could meditate in one of few different ways like breathing, banging on drums, colouring mandala, dancing. You can choose to do that individual in your private chambers or in group setting.

What if game presents you web 3 core ideas like wallet and DAO voting without you even realising that ?

What if instead of UI menus, the interface is like an ancient mnemonic temple where you interact with its elements ? 
What if the Player instead of operating the maze of user interface have to go in game locations that are easier to memorise ?

What if game communicates with you with graphical icon based language instead of just English ?

What if you have all important web3 elements in game so you donâ€™t have to spend $100 on ETH to learn ?

What if teams can help each other to bring harmony to the game world, win the season, and maybe let it creep a little to the real one ?

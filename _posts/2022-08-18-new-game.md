I dreamed of a game without combat mechanics that meets all the needs of collaboration within and between teams. I think we have enough fighting and enough clones to do something different.

Yes, I am working on a game design document I would like to present later and have a conversation about that. But, even before, I can give you a sneak peek of an idea that is brewing.

Instead of fighting, what if you meditate in-game to calm yourself and produce energy? Meditate in a few different ways like breathing, banging on drums, coloring mandala, and dancing. Choose to do that individually in your private area or in a group setting.

What if the game presents you web3 core ideas like wallet and DAO voting without you even realizing that?

Instead of UI menus, what if the interface is like an ancient mnemonic temple where you interact with its elements?
 
Instead of operating the maze of user interfaces, what if you go to in-game locations that are easier to memorize?

What if the game communicates with you with a graphical icon-based language instead of English?

What if you have all the core web3 elements in the game without spending $100 on ETH to learn?

What if teams can help each other bring harmony to the game world, win the season, and maybe let it creep a little to the real one?

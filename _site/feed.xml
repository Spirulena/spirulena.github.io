I think we have enough fighting and enough clones to do something different.</p>

<p>Yes, I am working on a game design document I would like to present later and have a conversation about that. But, even before, I can give you a sneak peek of an idea that is brewing.</p>

<p>Instead of fighting, what if you meditate in-game to calm yourself and produce energy? Meditate in a few different ways like breathing, banging on drums, coloring mandala, and dancing. Choose to do that individually in your private area or in a group setting.</p>

<p>What if the game presents you web3 core ideas like wallet and DAO voting without you even realizing that?</p>

<p>Instead of UI menus, what if the interface is like an ancient mnemonic temple where you interact with its elements?</p>

<p>Instead of operating the maze of user interfaces, what if you go to in-game locations that are easier to memorize?</p>

<p>What if the game communicates with you with a graphical icon-based language instead of English?</p>

<p>What if you have all the core web3 elements in the game without spending $100 on ETH to learn?</p>

<p>What if teams can help each other bring harmony to the game world, win the season, and maybe let it creep a little to the real one?</p>]]></content><author><name>Spirunela</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I dreamed of a game without combat mechanics that meets all the needs of collaboration within and between teams.
